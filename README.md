# Stats Comparative Analytics School Project

- Process and results of code is well-documented inside Plain_Text_Parsing.m and book.m
- **Plain_Text_Parsing.m is no longer being used by controller but was left included for
the sake of history**
- book.m uses more efficient processing techniques learnt after Plain_Text_Parsing.m was created
- *Controller.m and Controller_Female.m are essentially functions â€” should be rewritten for better efficiency*
- *supper_massive_blackhole.m is the main controller and data output script for the project*
- Plain text files can be sourced from https://www.gutenberg.org/
